The goal of this project is to develop the official Corona-Warn-App for Germany based on the exposure notification API from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/). The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **testresult server** for the Corona-Warn-App.

## About this component

In the world of the Corona Warn App the Test Result Server receives the results from laboratories and delivers these results to the app via the verification-server. The parts of the verification component cooperate in the following manner:

- The Verification Server of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-verification-server) helps validating whether upload requests from the mobile App are valid or not.
- The Verification Portal of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-verification-portal) allows hotline employees to generate teleTANs which are used by users of the mobile App to upload their diagnostic keys.
- The Verification Identity and Access of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-verification-iam) ensures that only authorized health personnel get access to the Verification Portal.
- The Test Result Server of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-testresult-server) receives the results from laboratories and delivers these results to the app via the verification-server.

So, this component receives the test results of COVID-19 Tests from connected laboratories. The information submitted by the laboratories contains an UUID and the result.    

## Development

This component can be locally build in order to test the functionality of the interfaces and verify the concepts it is build upon.  
There are two ways to build:
 - [Maven](https:///maven.apache.org) build - to run this component as spring application on your local machine
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com) build - to run it as docker container build from the provided docker build [file](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-verification-server/blob/master/Dockerfile)
 ### Prerequisites
 [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net)  
 [Maven](https://apache.maven.org)  
 *(optional)*: [Docker](https://www.docker.com)  
 ### Build
 Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

 In either case open a terminal pointing to the directory you put the sources in. The local build process is described afterwards depending on the way you choose.
#### Maven based build
For actively take part on the development this is the way you should choose.   
Please check, whether following prerequisites are fulfilled
- [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net) or a similar JDK 11 compatible VM  
- [Maven](https://apache.maven.org)  

is installed on your machine.  
You can then open a terminal pointing to the root directory of the verification server and do the following:

    mvn package
    java -jar target/cwa-testresult-server-*.jar  

The verification server will start up and run locally on your machine available on port 8080.

#### Docker based build  

We recommend that you first check the prerequisites to ensure that  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)  

is installed on you machine  

On the commandline do the following:
```bash
docker build -f|--file <path to dockerfile>  -t <imagename>  <path-to-testresultserver-root>
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp -it <imagename>
```
or simply  
```bash
docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t cwa-testresultserver "."
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp -it cwa-testresultserver
```
if you are in the root of the checked out repository.  
The docker image will then run on your local machine on port 8080 assuming you configured docker for shared network mode.

#### API Documentation  

Along with the application there comes an OpenApi Doc based swagger documentation which you can access in your web browser, when the test result server applications runs:  
````URL
<base-url>/api/swagger
````
Which results in the following URL on your local machine:
http://localhost:8080/api/swagger


## Working Language

We are building this application for Germany. We want to be as open and transparent as possible, also to interested parties in the global developer community who do not speak German. Later on this application might also serve as a template for other projects outside of Germany. For these reasons, we decided to apply _English_ as the primary project language.  

Consequently, all content will be made available primarily in English. We also ask all interested people to use English as language to create issues, in their code (comments, documentation etc.) and when you send requests to us. The application itself, documentation and all end-user facing content will - of course - be made available in German (and probably other languages as well). We also try to make some developer documentation available in German, but please understand that focussing on the _Lingua Franca_ of the global developer community makes the development of this application as efficient as possible.

## Documentation

The full documentation for the Corona-Warn-App can be found in the [cwa-documentation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation) repository. The documentation repository contains technical documents, architecture information, and white papers related to this implementation.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

## Contributors

The German government has asked SAP AG and Deutsche Telekom AG to develop the Corona-Warn-App for Germany as open source software. Deutsche Telekom is providing the network and mobile technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the app development, its framework and the underlying platform. Therefore, development teams of SAP and Deutsche Telekom are contributing to this project. At the same time our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -in fact encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.
